Thoughts to add to my previous list:

1. Extract data on people and marriages in TAB and CSV formats. The
   purpose of this is to use the superior reporting, data handling and
   presentation of spreadsheets, Tablemate and wordprocessors.

   The extraction should be by use of any set of criteria on the fields
   and flags of the data.

   The extraction should be of any set of fields and flags.

2. Somehow do the charting in Draw.  But any family trees must be more
   than a set of lines and boxes.  They must be linked, so that if you
   move a box (person), the lines move and extend or contract with the
   box.  The data in the boxes should move with the boxes; that data should
   be editable.

   And, even, it must be possible to move generations (rows of boxes)
   together - and to move branches, sets of descendants, together - around
   the chart.

   Finally one should be able to insert other objects, e.g pictures,
   anywhere on the chart, possibly linked to, and optionally in, the boxes
   and moving with them.  Perhaps pictures could be held in the database
   and automatically inserted at tree-drawing time.

Many people select a genealogy program for its chart drawing facilities,
they like to have something to show the relatives.  A solely
data-processing program is not enough.  But the chart-drawing is perhaps
the hardest bit to program as the slow development of Alex Waugh's Roots
program shows.

I'll try to include one in the manual for the next release.

This is possible if you edit the style by hand, although not currently
with the style editor.

Hmmm... not sure that I meant that - I was more interested in putting a
decorative frame around the title for the tree.

Here's what I'm doing with your program:

I'm slowly converting all my old draw files into !Roots files for easy
editing. The other idea that came to me is that I would like to include
the date the tree was created and/or subsequently updated. I add this
'by hand' at the moment.

The !Roots file is then saved and a drop shadow frame is added to the
whole tree and then converted into a GIF file for inclusion on the
internet. I use !TextEase for these two jobs 'cause its so easy to do
and get a file that will fit in the maximum width I have available in
the html frame.

I have yet to devise a style in !Roots that produces a narrow
enough tree - the Victorians always seem to have had lots of children! -
and so subsequently *always* move some of the marriage links to a space
below the male using !Draw. I do this to get the tree to fit a landscape
A4 sheet of paper or to fit the html frame.

I also add hot links into the tree by importing the GIF file into
!ImageMap2 to find out the coordinates of the names I've previously set
to a blue colour within !Draw. Because of this, I don't assign
male/female designations to a person within !Roots, but colour them
after I've exported the file. As I add more people, so this process is
repeated to change another name to a blue link, starting from the !Draw
file saved within Textease.

And lastly(!), I add roll-over buttons to the html page to link to other
pages. As I have *no* artistic talent, creating a simple button was a
big chore. Taking some of the routines you use in !Roots, it would be
easy to produce a program that did the job for me ... :-)

Cheers.

I assume you mean the Save entry on the file menu? If so, then it should
open the save dialogue window (It works on my machine). What is the
error message? Does it happen on all files or just some?

What is happening is that if the window is initially opened at its
maximum, when the toggle size icon is clicked, it moves back to its
default position as specified in the template file. On my machine, this
is near the top left corner of the screen. Presumably your screen is set
at a lower resolution, and thus this position is off the top of the
screen.
As a temporary fix, if you drop the attached !Roots on top of your
existing copy, it will change the default position of the window to the
bottom left corner, which should always be visible.

This is not a bug in Roots, it is a feature of the Draw module, which
Roots uses to draw all the lines. The effect may also be observed in
!Draw. A thickness of 0 is special in that it is always drawn 1 pixel
wide.

I am considering allowing arbitrary pieces of text or draw files to be
placed on the tree, which should make this possible.

I'll put this on the todo list.

The first enhancement mentioned above should allow this.

Good point. I think I might make it possible to drag a box which selects
all fields within the box, which can then be deleted.

I'm afraid this is not possible. When you hand-edit a style, you could
make it do all kinds of things, which the style editor cannot represent.
It is the intention that people who are able to edit the styles by hand
can do so, while the less techie people can use the editor. As ever, it
is a compromise between configurability/flexibility and an easy to use
interface.
I could add a check so that the editor can detect when a style has been
hand-edited, and give a warning if you try to overwrite it.

Bug reports and suggestions are always welcome.

Thanks

One more thought occurs after putting together a particularly tentative tree
from 1600s entries: traditionally, hand-draw trees show tentative links as
dotted lines. I can see this wouldn't be possible for a whole line from
marriage to child but would it be possible to have at least the child's
ascender drawn dotted? It could be signalled by doing (say) a shift/adjust
drag. The same would be useful for the paired marriage connecting lines -
marriages often take a 'shotgun' form on tentative trees.

I've taken the liberty of attaching the tree I'm working on at the moment, with
its custom style designed to suit my needs. As you can see, it's already rather
complex and I'm not even half way through the 1600s. Inevitably at this time of
the Civil War and regular Plagues, register entries were patchy and many
connections are speculative (hence the extra room allowed for text qualifiers).
Dotted lines and long-drop marriages would help enormously with clarity and
space. BTW, if you want to use the style or pass it on or use the tree as an
example, that's fine by me. Maybe you should have a section for user styles on
your web site?

Cheers,
-Neil.
