Things mentioned earlier in this email

3. The moving people and joining marriages and children is superb, BUT
4. The de-linking (graphically) of marriages is not so good - could the
lines linking marriages be extended automatically so that they're always
linking the partners?
5. Adding someone's middle name can easily extend outside a box. Could
there be an option to exclude middle names/turn them into initials
only/mark them in some way so that only part is shown on the tree.
NB Someone may be John Thomas Bloggs (and that be shown in full in the Edit
Person window but be known as John Bloggs or John T Bloggs or even J Thomas
Bloggs and the appropriate one of these should be shown on the tree.
6. Error - I came across OS error 486, 'SWI &80140 not known when trying to
print without loading the printer drivers
7. Possible extensions
Would it be possible to allow children from an individual without a
marriage or any other link? If so then there would be little modification
required to use the same program shell to produce:
a Organisation charts
b Evolutionary charts


choice of graphics style before importing gedcom?
