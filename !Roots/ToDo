Would it be possible to allow children from an individual without a
marriage or any other link? If so then there would be little modification
required to use the same program shell to produce:
a Organisation charts
b Evolutionary charts

choice of graphics style before importing gedcom?

(option) dont create extra spouses when marriage doesn't have both spouses


Emphasize in manual how layout is up to the user and is not controlled by roots, and mention how sibling lines can overlap etc

example graphics style that prints date of birth if avaliable else date of baptism? (Derrick porter)

BUG: if you select two people who are married, but not their marriage (in separate marriages mode) then delete them, if their mariage is earlier in the layout then it will get deleted but the loop in Layout_DeleteSelected will not take account of this and so might miss someone.


Ctrl-X in writeable icon seems to mess things up - does it replace 0 terminator with CR?

Load up a tree in default style, Remove all free memory, change to dropshadow style. Roots quits silently (is lua doing this?)



On 27 October 1999, Tim [Powys-Lybbe] emailed the Ancestry+ mail list you were running
at the time, as follows:

> Let's start:
> 
> 1. Core data entry facilities:
>    (a) People:
>        Must allow entry of forename, last name, date of birth, date of
>        death.
>        Must have options to allow other fields to be added to each
>        person, as decided by user, e.g.: education, occupation,
>        addresses, general notes, baptism, etc.
>        These option fields will either be dated, e.g. baptism, or
>        undated.  If dated, there may be multiple entries, as in
>        education.
>    (b) Marriages:
>        Must allow entry of date and place and and end-date with status, for
>        separation or divorce.
>        Again allow optional other fields, as for people.
> 
> 2. Sources of data:
>    (a) Start with a list of sources, as entered by the user.
>    (b) Every field must have a source entry attached to it; may be blank
>        of course.
>    (c) For people and marriages, there needs to be a General Source, that
>        covers all entries.
> 
> 3. Photos: Linked to people and to marriages.
> 
> 4. GEDCOM:  Must be able to handle GEDCOM 4.0 and 5.5 both for input
>    and output.
> 
> 5. Flags: These are essential for efficient selection for reporting.
>    (a) The user must be able to decide what flags to store for each
>        person and for each marriage.  These must be amendable and addable
>        and subtractable at any time.
>    (b) Probably each flag needs only be bivalent (Yes/No), though
>        Polyvalent might be useful, eg for clergymen, the values could be
>        curate / vicar / rector / canon / dean / bishop / archbishop, etc.
> 
> 6. Direct lines and relationships.  There must be sub-routines to
>    start with a person and write in to all lines whether each is a
>    direct ancestor and their relationship if any.
>    Direct line needs to be treated subsequently as a flag for reporting
>    purposes.
> 
> 7. Reporting: (reports, not charts)
>    To output a specifiable set of data for each person or
>    marriage reported.
>    To have facilities to select the people by ascent or descent and then
>    also by flag settings.
>    Do Ahentafel (sp?) reports.
> 
> 8. Charting: do ancestor, descendants charts starting from any person
>    Show a specifiable amount of data for each person and marriage.
>    Handle the objects on the charts as separate objects with "elastic
>    band" links to parents or children.
>    Optionally do hourglass charts, combining ancestors and descendants
>    of a given person.
> 
Thoughts to add to my previous list:

1. Extract data on people and marriages in TAB and CSV formats. The
   purpose of this is to use the superior reporting, data handling and
   presentation of spreadsheets, Tablemate and wordprocessors.

   The extraction should be by use of any set of criteria on the fields
   and flags of the data.

   The extraction should be of any set of fields and flags.

2. Somehow do the charting in Draw.  But any family trees must be more
   than a set of lines and boxes.  They must be linked, so that if you
   move a box (person), the lines move and extend or contract with the
   box.  The data in the boxes should move with the boxes; that data should
   be editable.

   And, even, it must be possible to move generations (rows of boxes)
   together - and to move branches, sets of descendants, together - around
   the chart.

   Finally one should be able to insert other objects, e.g pictures,
   anywhere on the chart, possibly linked to, and optionally in, the boxes
   and moving with them.  Perhaps pictures could be held in the database
   and automatically inserted at tree-drawing time.

Many people select a genealogy program for its chart drawing facilities,
they like to have something to show the relatives.  A solely
data-processing program is not enough.  But the chart-drawing is perhaps
the hardest bit to program as the slow development of Alex Waugh's Roots
program shows.
